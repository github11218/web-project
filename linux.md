## Colleboration

- In Git multiple devlopers can work and share together.

```bash

It could be windows user or linux user.

```

## Merge Conflicts

- First have pull the changes form the repo then have to edit and merge the code.
- It's easy for devlopers to check and mitigate the merge`conflicts`.
